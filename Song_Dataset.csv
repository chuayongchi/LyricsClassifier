Hey! Hey! Hey!  Four winds at the Four Winds Bar Two doors locked and windows barred One door left to take you in The other one just mirrors it  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  Hellish glare and inference The other one's a duplicate The Queenly flux, eternal light Or the light that never warms Yes the light that never, never warms Yes the light that never Never warms Never warms Never warms  The clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst Out at you from their hiding place Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar  It's the nexus of the crisis And the origin of storms Just the place to hopelessly Encounter time and then came me  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  Call me Desdinova Eternal light These gravely digs of mine Will surely prove a sight And don't forget my dog Fixed and consequent  Astronomy...a star"
